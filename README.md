## 1. Download the data

`data <- set_app_input(search_expr = "psoriatic arthritis", fields = for_explorer, max_studies = 500)`

## 2. Launch the app

`launch_explorer(data)`

There is a degree of flexiblity and the application will also attempt to launch with any dataframe argument.
For example, a dataframe coming from `data <- rctapi::get_study_fields()`.

## 3. Use the app

Inside the application there are different tabs that allow the user to interact with the dataframe.

The Help tab is marked "?"

NOTE: This package includes very little internal error handling.
